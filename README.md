Do you feel lucky? This app listens for notifications and pulls the trigger on a (MAX VOLUME) gun. Occasionally, you get hit. What\'s life without some risk?

"Occasionally" means 20 % of the time _for the sake of the demo_. In actual use, the app would trigger far less often (for example 1 % of the time).

A short demo video (without sound) can be found [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9j7Ze2Rnj0) (actual link for sanity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9j7Ze2Rnj0).
